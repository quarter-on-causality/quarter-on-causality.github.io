        <h3><b>Title: </b>Hierarchical Causal Models</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract"> Analyzing nested data with hierarchical models is a staple of Bayesian statistics, but causal modeling remains largely focused on "flat" models. In this talk, we will explore how to think about nested data in causal models, and consider the advantages of nested data over aggregate data (such as data means) for causal inference. We show that disaggregating your data---replacing a flat causal model with a hierarchical causal model---can provide new opportunities for identification and estimation. As examples, we will study how to identify and estimate causal effects under unmeasured confounders, interference, and instruments.

        <h3><b>Title:</b> Some fundamental problems in causal mediation analysis</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract"> Scientists are often interested in understanding mediating mechanisms that can help explain causal effects. A vast body of literature on mediation analysis has accumulated since two foundational articles (Robins and Greenland, 1992; Pearl, 2001) formalized mediation in the language of causality. However, causal mediation analysis poses many fundamental and interesting difficulties in its causal interpretation, nonparametric identification assumptions (which are much stronger than most typical causal assumptions), and statistical inference. I will discuss some of my work in each of these categories: (i) the interpretation of alternative estimands that have been proposed to circumvent the usual identification assumptions, (ii) the implicit assumptions embedded in the standard mediation identification assumptions and their shortcomings in handling the inherent time-varying nature of mediators, and (iii) the well-known issue of the conservative and underpowered nature of hypothesis testing for mediated effects.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Exogenous heterogeneity, for example in the form of instrumental variables, can help us learn a system's underlying causal structure and predict the outcome of unseen intervention experiments. In this talk, we discuss this idea in a setting in which the causal effect from covariates on the response is generally not identifiable as there may be more covariates than instruments, for example.</p>

        <h3><b>Title: </b>The role of instrumental variables in causal inference</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Causal inference methods based on conditional independence construct Markov equivalent graphs, and cannot be applied to bivariate cases. The approaches based on independence of cause and mechanism state, on the contrary, that causal discovery can be inferred for two observations. We challenge to reconcile these two research directions. We study the role of latent variables such as latent instrumental variables and hidden common causes in the causal graphical structures. We show that the methods based on the independence of cause and mechanism indirectly contain traces of the existence of the hidden instrumental variables. I will present our novel algorithm to infer causal relationships between two variables, which was validated on simulated data and on a benchmark of cause-effect pairs.</p>
