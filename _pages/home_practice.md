        <h3><b>Title:</b> Exploring cognition in the UK Biobank with causal mediation analysis</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Causal inference in observational studies is primarily used to measure the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome. Nevertheless, in a lot of fields, disentangling the mechanism of action is just as important, as it allows us to identify potential intermediate intervention targets, and more generally, deepen our understanding of the processes that lead to the observed outcome.
        Causal mediation analysis aims at separating the (total) causal effect into two components: an indirect effect through a third (group of) variable(s) called mediator(s), and a direct effect without intermediate. Most of existing methods are dedicated to the case of a one-dimension binary mediator, while the problem of considering several mediators is increasingly considered, especially for high dimension settings, such as gene expression or medical imaging.
        We perform a thorough evaluation of estimators for direct and indirect effects in the context of mediation analysis for binary, continuous and multi-dimensional mediators. We consider both parametric and semi-parametric estimators, and assess the relevance of several implementation variants, in particular regularization, non-parametric models for nuisance parameters estimation, probability calibration and cross-fitting.
        We then apply the mediation analysis framework to the exploration of cognitive function in a population of around 40,000 UK Biobank participants who underwent brain MRI, and a complete physical, sociodemographic, cognitive, and medical assessment. This prospective cohort is unique by its size, and the opportunity to disentangle the social and physiological components of human cognition. In a preliminary study, we consider several treatments believed to affect cognitive abilities. We found evidence of mediation by the brain structure for several of those exposures, in particular the ones that the organism physiology.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Automatic root cause identification is a challenging and important task in IT monitoring systems, where failures and anomalies can have severe consequences for businesses and customers. Traditional methods rely on manual rules, heuristics, or statistical correlations to identify the root causes of incidents, but often fail to capture the complex and dynamic dependencies among IT components. In this talk, a new framework will be presented that leverages causal discovery and causal reasoning to automatically infer root causes of IT incidents from observational time series data. The effectiveness of the framework will be demonstrated on simulated data as well as on real world monitoring data</p>

        <h3><b>Title:</b> Causal Analysis of Harm</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">As autonomous systems rapidly become ubiquitous, there is a growing need for a legal and regulatory framework that addresses when and how such a system harms someone. There have been several attempts within the philosophy literature to define harm, but none of them has proven capable of dealing with the many examples that have been presented, leading some to suggest that the notion of harm should be abandoned and “replaced by more well-behaved notions”. As harm is generally something that is caused, most of these definitions have involved causality at some level. Yet surprisingly, none of them makes use of causal models and the definitions of actual causality that they can express. In this paper we formally define a qualitative notion of harm that uses causal models and is based on a well-known definition of actual causality. The key features of our definition are that it is based on contrastive causation and uses a default utility to which the utility of actual outcomes is compared. We show that our definition is able to handle the examples from the literature, and illustrate its importance for reasoning about situations involving autonomous systems. The paper is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05327" target="_blank">here</a>. It is a joint work with Joseph Y. Halpern (Cornell University) and Hana Chockler (King's College London)</p>

            <p class="speaker-bio">Sander Beckers is a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation from the University of Amsterdam. He works on a variety of topics involving causation and causal modeling. Examples include the use of causal models to construct and discuss formal definitions of actual causation and their properties; the combination of causal models and the descriptions of actual causation to formally define other essential notions, such as harm, responsibility, and explanation, and the extension of the framework of causal models itself, so that they can express a broader range of relations. He is a philosopher, and his philosophical interests branch out to diverse areas that encompass the philosophy of Wittgenstein, the limitations of scientific knowledge, cultural relativism, and any topic in formal philosophy.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">The complier average causal effect (CACE) estimator, defined as the average of potential outcomes in the latent sub-population that complies with their assigned treatment, is more and more used in clinical trials to study the effect of a medication or an intervention rather than the effect of its prescription. Although advanced methods such as instrumental variables and G-estimation have been developed, it requires strong assumptions of exclusion restriction and principal ignorability. We propose a new approach to CACE estimation, in the vein of principal stratification framework, that does not require these assumptions. We estimate the latent distribution of four relevant groups of individuals: compliers, never-takers, always-takers and defiers. We reframe the problem as a missing data problem and introduce a two-step procedure that estimates CACE via the latent distribution of the principal strata.</p>

        <h3><b>Title:</b> Do machine learning methods lead to similar individualized treatment rules? A comparison study on real data.</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Identifying subgroups of patients who benefit from a treatment is a key aspect of personalized medicine. Developing individualized treatment rules (ITRs), which map individual characteristics to a treatment, can be achieved by identifying these subgroups. Many machine learning algorithms have been proposed to create such rules. Yet, it is unclear to what extent those algorithms lead to the same ITRs, i.e. recommending the treatment for the same individuals. To see if methods lead to similar ITRs, we compared the most common approaches in two randomized control trials: the International Stroke Trial and the CRASH-3 trial.
        Two classes of methods can be distinguished to develop an ITR. The first class of methods relies on predicting individualized treatment effects from which an ITR is derived by recommending the evaluated treatment to the individuals with a predicted benefit. In the second class, methods directly estimate the ITR without estimating individualized treatment effects. The majority of the methods compared in this project fell under the first class: meta-learners (T-learner, S-learner, X-learner, DR- learner, and R-learner, both with parametric and non-parametric models), causal forests, and virtual twins, whereas A-learning, modified covariate method, outcome weighted learning and contrast weighted learning fell under the second class. When using non-parametric models, results were compared with and without cross-fitting. For each trial, the performance of ITRs was assessed in terms of value of the rule, average benefit of treatment among people with a positive score and among people with a negative score, population average prescription effect, and c-statistic for benefit. The pairwise agreement between ITRs was also calculated using Cohen’s kappa and Matthews correlation coefficients.
        Results showed that the ITRs obtained by the different methods generally had considerable disagreements regarding the individuals to be treated. A better concordance was found among akin methods (e.g. among all meta-learners with parametric models, or all meta-learners with non- parametric models and cross-fitting). Overall, when evaluating the performance of ITRs in a hold-out validation sample, all methods produced ITRs with limited performance, whatever the performance in the training set, which suggests a high potential for overfitting.
        The different methods do not lead to similar ITRs, and are, therefore, not interchangeable. The chosen method has a lot of influence on which patients end up being given a certain treatment which draws some concerns about the practical use of the methods.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Comorbidities, existing conditions alongside cancer diagnosis, are prevalent among approximately 50% of cancer patients. These comorbidities often involve the intake of chronic medications, known as comedications. The influence of specific comedications on the long-term progression of Breast Cancer has been established by various studies. Several observational studies illustrated the influence of certain comedications on the long-term evolution of Breast Cancer. However, the analysis of the impact of comedications using observational data is a challenging causal inference task which requires extensive, high-quality datasets, and which may be prone to several types of causal biases. This presentation aims to share the findings of the ADRENALINE study, which aims to analyze the effects of comedications on breast cancer survival across the entire population of breast cancer patients in France. We will explore the causal inference framework essential for drawing meaningful conclusions, address the assumptions underlying this framework in this specific example, and discuss the advantages and limitations associated with such a comprehensive undertaking.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">In this talk I will introduce the <em>functional causal Bayesian optimization method</em> (FCBO) for finding interventions that optimize a target variable in a known causal graph. FCBO extends CBO to perform, in addition to hard interventions, functional interventions which consist in setting a variable to be a deterministic function of a set of other variables in the graph. This is achieved by modelling the unknown objective with Gaussian processes whose inputs are defined in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, thus allowing to compute distances among vector-valued functions. In turn, this enables to sequentially select functions to explore by maximizing an expected improvement acquisition functional while keeping the typical computational tractability of standard BO settings. We show that functional interventions can attain better target effects compared to hard interventions and ensure that the found optimal policy is also optimal for sub-groups. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in a synthetic setting and in a real-world causal graph.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">In a structural causal model, primitive causal relations are encoded as functional dependencies, which then map onto a graph. In this talk, we capture causality without reference to graphs or functional dependencies, but with information sigma-algebras. In the first part, we present the so-called Witsenhausen intrinsic model (WIM), originally developed for control theory. In the second part, we introduce the Information Dependency Model, as another way to handle causal relations based on the WIM. Then, we define the notion of topological separation (t-separation), which we prove to be equivalent to d-separation. We illustrate the potential of t-separation on examples.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">This study demonstrates the existence of a testable condition for the identification of the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome in observational data, which relies on two sets of variables: observed covariates to be controlled for and a suspected instrument. Under a causal structure commonly found in empirical applications, the testable conditional independence of the suspected instrument and the outcome given the treatment and the covariates has two implications. First, the instrument is valid, i.e. it does not directly affect the outcome (other than through the treatment) and is unconfounded conditional on the covariates. Second, the treatment is unconfounded conditional on the covariates such that the treatment effect is identified. We suggest tests of this conditional independence based on machine learning methods that account for covariates in a data-driven way and investigate their asymptotic behavior and finite sample performance in a simulation study. We also apply our testing approach to evaluating the impact of fertility on female labor supply when using the sibling sex ratio of the first two children as supposed instrument, which by and large points to a violation of our testable implication for the moderate set of socio-economic covariates considered.

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract"> We present a general framework for evaluating image counterfactuals. The power and flexibility of deep generative models make them valuable tools for learning mechanisms in structural causal models. However, their flexibility makes counterfactual identifiability impossible in the general case. Motivated by these issues, we revisit Pearl's axiomatic definition of counterfactuals to determine the necessary constraints of any counterfactual inference model: composition, reversibility, and effectiveness. We frame counterfactuals as functions of an input variable, its parents, and counterfactual parents and use the axiomatic constraints to restrict the set of functions that could represent the counterfactual, thus deriving distance metrics between the approximate and ideal functions. We demonstrate how these metrics can be used to compare and choose between different approximate counterfactual inference models and to provide insight into a model's shortcomings and trade-offs.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Marketing has embraced the causal revolution, mainly through experimentation methods such as A/B testing. However, several marketing practices based only on observational data must be combined with the causal inference approaches. It is particularly valid for Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM). Marketing Mix Modelling aims to estimate Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) of marketing activities carried out over a given period, commonly named uplift modeling. In practice, directly applying the methods developed by researchers is usually challenging because many assumptions are violated (e.g., the presence of hidden confounders and the mixture of categorical and continuous variables). Moreover, the two significant issues of MMM data are their low diversity and the high correlations of the variables (mostly spurious ones), leading marketing experts to usually make assumptions about the causal structure linking variables to interpret statistical results. This talk will discuss how causal inference can be introduced in MMM practices and improve them thanks to a Causal Data Augmentation strategy. We will discuss how modeling experts' knowledge before the estimation phase helps break down datasets' dependencies and simplifies the subsequent statistical analysis. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">The definition of correlates of protection is critical for the development of next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms. The complete chains of causality and interrelationships between vaccination, immune responses, protection and clinical endpoints are likely to be considerably complex. In this work, we propose a model-based approach for identifying mechanistic correlates of protection against disease acquisition based on mathematical modeling of viral dynamics and data mining of immunological markers. We apply the method to three different studies in non-human primates evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on CD40-targeting, two-component spike nanoparticle and mRNA 1273. Inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 appears to be a robust mechanistic correlate of protection across the three vaccine platforms although not capturing the whole biological vaccine effect.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract"> Uncovering cause-effect relationships in non-experimental settings has shown to be a very complex endeavour, given the numerous limitations and biases found in observational data. At the same time, there are many situations in which experiments cannot be performed, be it due to technical, financial or ethical reasons, and large amounts of observational data are available. Recent progress in causal discovery methodologies, and in the causal inference literature in general, has contributed to the development of techniques that learn the underlying causal structure of the events recorded through observational data, allowing us to perform causal discovery and inference in observational data. In this talk, I will go through iMIIC, a novel information-theoretic method that allows us to infer interpretable networks, and its application to a dataset of ~400,000 breast cancer patients.</p>

        <h3><b>Title:</b> Diffusion Models for Causal Discovery via Topological Ordering</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Discovering causal relations from observational data becomes possible with additional assumptions such as considering the functional relations to be constrained as nonlinear with additive noise (ANM). Even with strong assumptions, causal discovery involves an expensive search problem over the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Topological ordering approaches reduce the optimisation space of causal discovery by searching over a permutation rather than graph space. For ANMs, the Hessian of the data log-likelihood can be used for finding leaf nodes in a causal graph, allowing its topological ordering. However, existing computational methods for obtaining the Hessian still do not scale as the number of variables and the number of samples are increased. Therefore, inspired by recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), we propose DiffAN, a topological ordering algorithm that leverages DPMs for learning a Hessian function. We introduce theory for updating the learned Hessian without re-training the neural network, and we show that computing with a subset of samples gives an accurate approximation of the ordering, which allows scaling to datasets with more samples and variables. We show empirically that our method scales exceptionally well to datasets with up to nodes and up to samples while still performing on par over small datasets with state-of-the-art causal discovery methods. Implementation is available at <a href="https://github.com/vios-s/DiffAN" target="_blank">https://github.com/vios-s/DiffAN</a>.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">The limited scope of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) is increasingly under scrutiny, in particular when samples are unrepresentative. Indeed, some RCTs over/under-sample individuals with certain characteristics compared to the target population, for which one want to draw conclusions on treatment effectiveness. Re-weighting trial individuals to match the target population helps to improve the treatment effect estimation. Such procedures require an estimation of the ratio of the two densities (trial and target distributions). In this talk, we focus on finite-sample performances of such reweighting procedures - also called Inverse Propensity of Sampling Weighting (IPSW) - in presence of categorical covariates. We compare oracle versions of these estimates (when the trial/target distribution or the propensity score are known). Our finite-sample analysis enables us to derive precise asymptotic regimes depending on the two sample sizes (RCT and target population). In particular, we show that IPSW estimates do not benefit from using the true trial distribution if available and that IPSW performances are improved when the trial probability to be treated is estimated. In addition, we study how including covariates that are unnecessary for identifiability may impact the asymptotic variance and illustrate the results on a semi-synthetic simulation inspired from critical care medicine.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">We can postulate a cause to be constituted of many components, some of which may not even have an well-posed way of being controlled. How will a CV land you a job? That is, to which extent does it make sense to say "my well-written CV caused me to be offered this position"? We can postulate causal meaning to the contribution of a writing clinic program for job applicants to better prepare themselves, but what is the role of the content of the document itself? Replacing words in a document may be the wrong abstraction to think about cause-effect quantification. We suggest ways by which better-posed causal models and questions can deal with such structured causes.
        
        However, even when we are lucky and each individual component of a structured cause can be individually designed, it doesn’t mean novel challenges won’t arise. How do we learn causal effects when the treatment may be something complex such as the molecular structure of a drug component? Machine learning can aid here with ideas from representation learning.

        <h3><b>Title:</b> Learning causal variables with machine learning</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Science and decision-making require us to infer the effects of interventions. Does knocking out a given gene suppress a function of interest? Does a proposed tax actually change some behavior of interest? Causal models provide a language to model interventions, and help us derive assumptions that yield valid causal inference. Despite the role causality plays in the sciences, the applications of causal inference have been limited, often restricted to questions where all the variables are carefully measured. In contrast, the field of machine learning (ML) has arguably succeeded at extracting task-relevant information from unstructured inputs such as text and images, inputs that implicitly capture abstract variables. Nevertheless, variables inferred using ML may not be substitutes for the underlying but unknown causal variables: ML methods may entangle the underlying causal variables, or neglect to capture them, biasing downstream causal inference. In this talk, I'll discuss two approaches to learning causally relevant variables. First, I'll introduce causally sufficient text embeddings, a general method that leverages causal model structure to learn causal variables from text data. Next, I'll discuss recent work, inspired by biological tasks, that exploits evolution in the causal mechanism mapping inputs to a target of interest to learn causal variables. Finally, I'll conclude by highlighting ongoing and open research to address the challenges of causal reasoning with ML.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Quantifying cause and effect relationships is an important problem in many domains. The gold standard solution is to conduct a randomised controlled trial. However, in many situations such trials cannot be performed. In the absence of such trials, many methods have been devised to quantify the causal impact of an intervention from observational data given certain assumptions. One widely used method are synthetic control models. While identifiability of the causal estimand in such models has been obtained from a range of assumptions, it is widely and implicitly assumed that the underlying assumptions are satisfied for all time periods both pre- and post-intervention. This is a strong assumption, as synthetic control models can only be learned in pre-intervention period. In this paper we address this challenge, and prove identifiability can be obtained without the need for this assumption, by showing it follows from the principle of invariant causal mechanisms. Moreover, for the first time, we formulate and study synthetic control models in Pearl's structural causal model framework. Importantly, we provide a general framework for sensitivity analysis of synthetic control causal inference to violations of the assumptions underlying non-parametric identifiability. We end by providing an empirical demonstration of our sensitivity analysis framework on simulated and real data in the widely-used linear synthetic control framework.</p>

        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">In this session we will try to explore together both the capabilities and ultimate limitations of large language models (LLMs) when it comes to causal inference. While some researchers argue that scale is all what is needed to achieve AI, covering even causal models, throughout our session it will become clear that the all-scaled-up LLMs cannot be causal and we will give reason onto why sometimes we might feel otherwise when interacting with them. We conjecture that in the cases were LLM indeed succeed in doing causal inference, underlying was a respective meta SCM that exposed correlations between causal facts in natural language on whose data the LLM was ultimately trained. If our hypothesis holds true, then this would imply that LLMs are like parrots in that they simply recite the causal knowledge embedded in the data. Put differently: just knowing, not understanding.</p>

        <h3><b>Title:</b> Almost exact Mendelian randomization</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Mendelian randomization (MR) is a natural experimental design based on the random transmission of genes from parents to offspring. However, this inferential basis is typically only implicit or used as an informal justification. As parent-offspring data becomes more widely available, we advocate a different approach to MR that is exactly based on this natural randomization, thereby formalizing the analogy between MR and randomized controlled trials. We begin by developing a causal graphical model for MR which represents several biological processes and phenomena, including population structure, gamete formation, fertilization, genetic linkage, and pleiotropy. This causal graph is then used to detect biases in population-based MR studies and identify sufficient confounder adjustment sets to correct these biases. We then propose a randomization test in the within-family MR design using the exogenous randomness in meiosis and fertilization, which is extensively studied in genetics. Besides its transparency and conceptual appeals, our approach also offers some practical advantages, including robustness to misspecified phenotype models, robustness to weak instruments, and elimination of bias arising from population structure, assortative mating, dynastic effects, and horizontal pleiotropy. We conclude with an analysis of a pair of negative and positive controls in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.</p>
