        <h3><b>Title:</b>New pipeline to define mechanistic correlates of protection: application to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">The definition of correlates of protection is critical for the development of next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms. The complete chains of causality and interrelationships between vaccination, immune responses, protection and clinical endpoints are likely to be considerably complex. In this work, we propose a model-based approach for identifying mechanistic correlates of protection against disease acquisition based on mathematical modeling of viral dynamics and data mining of immunological markers. We apply the method to three different studies in non-human primates evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on CD40-targeting, two-component spike nanoparticle and mRNA 1273. Inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 appears to be a robust mechanistic correlate of protection across the three vaccine platforms although not capturing the whole biological vaccine effect.</p>

        <h3><b>Title:</b> Diffusion Models for Causal Discovery via Topological Ordering</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Discovering causal relations from observational data becomes possible with additional assumptions such as considering the functional relations to be constrained as nonlinear with additive noise (ANM). Even with strong assumptions, causal discovery involves an expensive search problem over the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Topological ordering approaches reduce the optimisation space of causal discovery by searching over a permutation rather than graph space. For ANMs, the Hessian of the data log-likelihood can be used for finding leaf nodes in a causal graph, allowing its topological ordering. However, existing computational methods for obtaining the Hessian still do not scale as the number of variables and the number of samples are increased. Therefore, inspired by recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), we propose DiffAN, a topological ordering algorithm that leverages DPMs for learning a Hessian function. We introduce theory for updating the learned Hessian without re-training the neural network, and we show that computing with a subset of samples gives an accurate approximation of the ordering, which allows scaling to datasets with more samples and variables. We show empirically that our method scales exceptionally well to datasets with up to nodes and up to samples while still performing on par over small datasets with state-of-the-art causal discovery methods. Implementation is available at <a href="https://github.com/vios-s/DiffAN" target="_blank">https://github.com/vios-s/DiffAN</a>.</p>
