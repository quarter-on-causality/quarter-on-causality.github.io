<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <p>The <strong>Study Week on Causal Inference for Industry</strong> is an intensive problem-solving workshop that brings together Ph.D. students, young researchers, and industrial partners. In the course of one week, small groups of researchers of different backgrounds will intensively brainstorm and work together to model and solve real-world challenges provided by industrial partners. On Monday, each company representative presents their problem, after which the participants choose a problem to work on for the remainder of the week along with the industrial partner. On Friday morning, each group presents their solution to the chosen problem.</p>
    <p>The study week warmly welcomes a broad scientific audience, including applied mathematics, engineering, statistics, and computer science.</p>

     <h2>Week overview</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>On <strong>Monday</strong> morning, company representatives present their challenge, after which participants can ask questions in a brief Q&A. During lunch time, each participant chooses a challenge to work on during the remainder of the week, while ensuring that groups remain balanced in size. Group work together with the company representative is planned for the afternoon. To close the first day, everyone is invited to a reception.</li>
       <li> On <strong>Tuesday</strong> is entirely devoted to work group.</li>
       <li> <strong>Wednesday</strong> morning is dedicated to work group. In the afternoon, we invite company representatives to join their group to continue working on the challenge. In the evening, we enjoy a nice study week dinner at restaurant Chez Camille</li>
       <li><strong>Thursday</strong> is the last day of the work group, in which each group starts to prepare their presentation of the results.</li>
       <li>On <strong>Friday</strong>, each group presents the approach and obtained results for their challenge. Company representatives give direct feedback. The study week is closed with a lunch.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Technical report</h2>
     <p>Apart from the presentation of the groups on the Friday morning session, we also expect each group to produce a technical report that summarizes the work that was carried out. It includes the methods that were tried, the used literature, the experimental results, conclusions, and further works. We do not expect you to work on the report during the study week (focus during the week should be on the problem). We instead like to receive your reports by the end of September 2023.</p>

        <h3><b>Causal Discovery from Sequential Data</b> </h3><br />
        <b>Description</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Saint-Gobain Distribution Bâtiment France (SGDBF) is dedicated to developing innovative solutions that enhance well-being and contribute to a sustainable future. They have gathered extensive data on client interactions and actions as part of their efforts. This sequential data provides valuable insights into clients’ identities and behaviors, and understanding the causal relationships within this data can unlock numerous possibilities for improving customer understanding and anticipating future actions. This problem aims to unravel the causal structures hidden within the sequential data of Saint-Gobain's clients. By identifying causal relationships, one can better understand clients' needs and behaviors, develop more relevant and efficient recommendation systems. Furthermore, capturing the structure that governs the sequentiality of client actions allows one to anticipate clients' future needs and provide tailored solutions.

        <h3><b>Estimating Marketing Uplifts as Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Meta-learners</b> </h3><br />
        <b>Description</b><p class="speaker-abstract">Marketing can be defined as a set of techniques to study a company's business strategy with regard to the market. Among these techniques, Mix Marketing Modeling (MMM) is used to optimize the commercial strategy maximizing the sales volume. MMM consists in modeling the contributions, called uplifts, of each marketing activity to the sales revenue. The goal is to estimate the Return On Investment (ROI) of the numerous marketing campaigns to decide on the next marketing plan.
