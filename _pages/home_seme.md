</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <p>The <strong>Study week Causal Inference for Industry</strong> is an intensive problem-solving workshop that brings together Ph.D. students, young researchers, and industrial partners. In the course of one week, small groups of researchers of different backgrounds will intensively brainstorm and work together to model and solve real-world challenges provided by industrial partners. On Monday, each company representative presents their problem, after which the participants choose a problem to work on for the remainder of the week along with the industrial partner. On Friday morning, each group presents their solution to the chosen problem.</p>
    <p>The study week warmly welcomes a broad scientific audience, including applied mathematics, engineering, statistics, and computer science.</p>

      <li>You get in contact with potential employers, both during group work as in several networking opportunities offered during the study week</li>
      <li>You experience working in and as a team, which is very different compared to working on your research topic as an individual</li>
      <li>By working in a team, you further develop interpersonal and communication skills</li>
      <li>By meeting and discussing with fellow researchers, new research ideas and collaborations may arise</li>

     <h2>Week overview</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>On <strong>Monday</strong> morning, company representatives present their challenge, after which participants can ask questions in a brief Q&A. During lunch time, each participant chooses a challenge to work on during the remainder of the week, while ensuring that groups remain balanced in size. Group work together with the company representative is planned for the afternoon. To close the first day, everyone is invited to a reception.</li>
       <li> On <strong>Tuesday</strong> is entirely devoted to work groups. Coffee breaks and lunches are always together.</li>
       <li> <strong>Wednesday</strong> morning is dedicated to work group. In the afternoon, we invite company representatives to join their group to continue working on the challenge. In the evening, we enjoy a nice study week dinner at restaurant Chez Camille</li>
       <li><strong>Thursday</strong> is the last day of the work group, in which each group starts to prepare their presentation of the results.</li>
       <li>On <strong>Friday</strong>, each group presents the approach and obtained results for their challenge. Company representatives give direct feedback. The study week is closed with a lunch.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Technical report</h2>
     <p>Apart from the presentation of the groups on the Friday morning session, we also expect each group to produce a technical report that summarizes the work that was carried out. It includes the methods that were tried, the used literature, the experimental results, conclusions, and further works. We do not expect you to work on the report during the study week (focus during the week should be on the problem). We instead like to receive your reports by the end of September 2023.</p>
